The main aim of Reinsurance-Data is to

 - increase benefit for all due to no cost
 - share effort of data ingestion and cleaning
 - share knowledge and thus provide solid insights
 
<h2>Content</h2>

Reinsurance Data is based on the annual financial statements released by the reinsurance companies (for details see the [list of companies](#companies) below. To enable further analysis of all contents a fact table and some dimension tables are created, which is necessary if you want to bild a star schema in your favourite BI-Tool.

Details on the data structure, the initial clean-up and available tables can be found in the DATA-README.md

I hope this will enable you to create peer analyses, financial performance tests and to derive insights - or to do with the data whatever you can think of.

<h2>üõ£ Roadmap</h2>

Following steps are in progress or planned - feel free to contribute and share your ideas!

- Collection of financial statemens as raw data from the companies websites (in progress)
- Draft data model tables (in progress)
- Initial clean-up and transformation of the data (ongoing)
- Provide first minimum viable product (planned)
